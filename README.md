============

This Repo is for the MICS ~~2014~~ 2015 Robotics compitition

This year our team tried to use an arduino with the NXShield created by OpenElectionics.
A user guide can be found here: http://www.openelectrons.com/index.php?module=documents&JAS_DocumentManager_op=viewDocument&JAS_Document_id=1, as well as an advanced guide and a tutorial.
The user guide contains a lot of useful links, but the key ones can be found below.
